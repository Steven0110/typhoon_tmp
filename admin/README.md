# Typhoon Offshore - Static Portfolio Demo

This is a static HTML/CSS/JS demo of the Typhoon Offshore admin interface for portfolio purposes. It showcases the frontend design and UI interactions without requiring a backend server.

## Features

- Login page with simulated authentication
- Dashboard with sample data visualization
- Responsive design using Bootstrap 4

## How to Use

1. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the login page
2. Enter any username and password in the login form and click the button
3. You will be redirected to a static dashboard demo

## Original Project

This is based on a Laravel 5.4 project. The static version maintains the look and feel of the original application while making it possible to showcase it without requiring PHP or a database. Due limitations from an absent backend, the features showcased are less than the actual project. The code for all these features can be found in this repository.

## Note

This is for demonstration purposes only. No actual backend functionality is included.
